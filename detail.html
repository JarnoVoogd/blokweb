                <p>Often cited as Amsterdam’s most charming neighbourhood, wandering into the <a href="#">Jordaan</a> feels like stepping back in time. Originally a working-class area, the Jordaan’s narrow streets and quaint buildings now make up one of Amsterdam’s most desirable

                    in a small sandwich with pickles and onions. The best time to try raw herring is between May and July when the herring is said to be at its sweetest. Still hungry? See if you can taste your way through all of these <a href="#">traditional Dutch snacks</a>
